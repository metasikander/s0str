A private nostr relay

# Why
A private relay is a great way to make sure that your notes are always available.  

# How
The relay will only save notes from a particular privatekey, and ignore all others,  
but let anyone request the notes that it has saved.  

The software will accept settings from a file or enviromental variables, and be connected to a postgresql database.
